Netflix Titles Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix's catalog of TV shows and movies using SQL queries to gain insights into various aspects of the dataset. The data includes information about each title, such as genre, release year, IMDb scores, duration, director, and more. Additionally, a user ratings table is included to understand viewer feedback.

Key Objectives:
Identify popular content trends based on IMDb scores, genres, and viewer ratings.
Find top-rated shows or movies by decade, genre, or director.
Examine which types of content generate the most engagement.
Use SQL concepts such as joins, aggregation, filtering, and grouping to extract meaningful insights.
